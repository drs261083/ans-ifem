This code was developed starting from the example
step-33 of the deal.II FEM library.

This file is subject to QPL and may not be distributed without
copyright and license information. Please refer to section 5 of this
file for further information on this license.

============================================================
1. Deal.II Requirements:
============================================================

The FEIBM source code is based on the deal.II 7.3.0 library. It 
has also been tested with the current svn release deal.II 8.0.pre,
and a CMakeLists.txt file which will allow you to compile it with
later deal.II versions has been included.

In what follows, we assume that the user has installed the deal.II
library in the directory

DEAL_II_DIR

and that the user has defined the enviroment variable DEAL_II_DIR 
to point to the correct location. If this enviroment variable is 
not set, the program will not compile and run properly.
For the program to work properly, deal.II should be configured at
least with the flag "--with-umfpack", e.g., by typing

./configure --with-umfpack
make all

to enable UMFPACK direct solver.
  
============================================================
2. Installation procedure:
============================================================

The provided tgz archive should be unzipped in a dedicated 
subdirectory, with the commands

cd PATH_WHERE_YOU_WANT_THIS_CODE
tar xvfz step-feibm.tgz

The program can then be compiled by running

cd step-feibm
make

or 

make run

which will run a trivial test.

If you want to use later versions of deal.II, you can use
the CMakeLists.txt file in the extracted directory to compile
using the cmake system:

cmake .
make 

or 

make run

============================================================
3. Running instructions:
============================================================

Once the program has been compiled, it can be run by typing 

./step-feibm

or 

./step-feibm parameters.prm

in the directory step-feibm.
The program uses parameter files to set its runtime variables. The
file 

immersed_fem.prm 

is an example of such files, and it is the default one used if none is
specified at run time. If the specified file does not exists, the
program will attempt to create one with default values for you. 
The directory 

prms/

contains all parameter files used to produce the results presented in
the paper.

============================================================
4. Extensive documentation:
============================================================

If the user has the program Doxygen installed, a complete and
browsable documentation of the source code itself can be generated in
one of two ways: 

1. 

cd step-feibm/doc
make

In this case, the documentation will be accessible at the
address

DEAL_II_DIR/examples/step-feibm/doc/html/index.html


2.
If the user wants the deal.II documentation to be inlined, then 
the code should be extracted under the $DEAL_II_DIR/examples 
directory, i.e., under $DEAL_II_DIR/examples/step-feibm.
The documentation has been constructed in a way which is compatible
with the examples structure of the deal.II library. If the code is
extracted in the examples directory, then by typing

cd DEAL_II_DIR/
make online-doc

then the entire deal.II documentation, 
together with the documentation of the step-feibm
source code, will be accessible at the address

DEAL_II_DIR/doc/doxygen/deal.II/step_feibm.html

In the second case, the process is a lot longer but the documentation
generated thus has the added benefits of being fully integrated with
the |deal.II| documentation as well as having hyperlinks to all
the |deal.II| classes that have been used in our program.

5. Licence Informations
============================================================

The step-feibm library has been placed under an Open Source license,
in the sense advocated by the Open Source Initiative. 

You are thus free to copy and use it, and you have free access to all
source codes. However, step-feibm is not in the public domain, it is
property of and copyrighted by the authors, and there are restrictions
on its use. We will give some hints on license issues first. The
legally binding license is the Q Public License (QPL), included here:
